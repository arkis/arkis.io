# arkis.io
Website for Arkis, a project development group I briefly formed with friends from high school

This website is now defunct, however pieces of the front-end development work I did are live on my CodePen:

- [**Arkis Logo Animation**](https://codepen.io/controversial/full/ZxQYwJ) - the CSS animation that greeted users when they entered the site
- [**Mist animation**](https://codepen.io/controversial/full/QmGRpP) - the "mist" animation that appeared at the bottom of the site that users scrolled through. This was one of the site's most distinctive visual elements
- [**Spinner Expand Animation**](https://codepen.io/controversial/full/jzBLrm) - the loader interaction that appeared after users submitted contact form requests
